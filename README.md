TOP Project #1 - Google Homepage Clone

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This was the first ever project that I completed for The Odin Project's online curriculum.

~~ MAIN AIMS ~~
The main aims of this project were to create a web page that looked similar/identical to the Google homepage (as of July 2021) using solely HTML and CSS. As it is the first ever assignment in The Odin Project, it tested the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS code for both structure and styling, including the layout and positioning of elements.

~~ CHALLENGES ~~
I found that structuring and ordering elements on the page, even with Flexbox, was quite a challenge. Simply centering something vertically and horizontally with CSS was something that took me a while to figure out, and I had to resist the urge to just manually position everything on the page with position:fixed! I did end up using fixed positioning for elements that would theoretically remain in place anyway, such as the footer and the header, as well as some other elements like the profile icon in the upper right, but the other elements were positioned with flexbox within their respective divs.

It also took some fiddling to adjust the main search box's size and curvature, but using some padding on both sides allowed me to fit the icons and text nicely together.

~~ IMPROVEMENTS ~~
If I were to come back to this project, I would try to improve the site's responsiveness on different devices. Currently, resizing the screen causes some text overlapping and shifting icons, which is definitely not ideal.
